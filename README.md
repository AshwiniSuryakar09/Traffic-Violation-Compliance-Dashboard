> ## üîç Key Insights 
  * ### 1.Low Violation Resolution Rate :-

    Less than half of all traffic violations have been resolved, indicating potential inefficiencies in enforcement or follow-up mechanisms.

  * ### 2.High Proportion of Active and Ignored Violations :-
  
     A significant percentage of violations remain either active or ignored, suggesting that many infractions go unaddressed, which could undermine compliance efforts.
  
  * ### 3. Severe Violations Are the Most Common :-
    
     Severe violations make up the largest share, highlighting the need for stricter enforcement and possibly harsher penalties for dangerous behavior.
     
  * ### 4. Red Light, Helmet, and Speeding Violations Are Top Offenses :-

     These categories dominate, signaling key areas where public awareness and policy reinforcement are most urgently needed.
    
  * ### 5. City-wise Disparity in Violations :-
    
     Some cities (e.g., New York, London, Sydney) have significantly higher active violations, suggesting the need for targeted local interventions.

  * ### 6. Faster Turnaround Time Doesn‚Äôt Guarantee Resolution :- 

     Even with short turnaround targets (<1 day or <12 hours), many violations remain unresolved, pointing to process bottlenecks or inadequate resources.

  * ### 7. Compliance Is a Minority

    Only a small fraction of the total cases are fully compliant, indicating that overall adherence to traffic rules is low and requires educational or behavioral change initiatives.

  * ### 8.Medium and Light Violations Are Often Solved

    These are being addressed more effectively compared to severe ones, possibly due to lower complexity or quicker resolution workflows.

> ## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The Traffic Violation and Compliance Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of traffic-related offenses, highlighting key compliance challenges. The data reveals that a large proportion of violations remain unresolved or ignored, with severe infractions being the most prevalent. Cities like New York and London experience higher rates of active violations, indicating regional enforcement gaps. Despite efforts to resolve issues quickly, resolution rates remain suboptimal‚Äîespecially for severe violations‚Äîunderscoring the need for stronger enforcement mechanisms, public awareness campaigns, and better compliance monitoring. Strengthening resolution workflows and focusing on high-risk areas could significantly improve traffic safety and rule adherence.
